	<h1>Naming Conventions</h1>
	<p>One wonderful thing about the world of jQuery is our contributors. The capabilities of jQuery are vast. Everyday, people are creating new products and ideas using the many facets of jQuery. It's important that everyone follows proper naming conventions so that we keep the infrastructure of jQuery and its many brands strong. This not only helps the jQuery Foundation with future products, but also its many, many generous contributors.</p>

<div id="branding-your-tagline">
	<h2>Branding your tagline</h2>

	<p class="p-small">When naming a jQuery plugin built on any of the jQuery frameworks, make sure that you stand out! Make sure that your plugin has a memorable title and a tagline that makes reference to the framework you're using.</p>

	<h3>✅ Good</h3>

		<div class="six columns">
			<h4>Product name:</h4>
			<p>Extreme Slider</p>
		</div>
		<div class="six columns">
			<h4>Product tagline:</h4>
			<p>The most extreme jQuery Image Slider</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<h3>❌ Bad</h3>

		</div>
		<div class="six columns">

<div id="using-jquery-in-your-name">
	<h2>Using jQuery in your name</h2>

	<p>Another way to properly name and present your jQuery product is to put jQuery directly in the name.</p>

	<h3>✅ Good</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="six columns">
			<h4>Product name:</h4>
			<p>jQuery Filterable Plugin</p>
		</div>
		<div class="six columns">
			<h4>Product tagline:</h4>
			<p>A jQuery UI compatible plugin to allow users to quickly bring large lists of data down to a manageable size.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<h3>❌ Bad</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="six columns">
			<h4>Product name:</h4>
			<p>A Filtererable Plugin Made With jQuery</p>
		</div>
		<div class="six columns">
			<h4>Product tagline:</h4>
			<p>Pare that list down to size!</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Can't think of a catchy and fun name? No problem. Within the examples shown, you can see how the guidelines are followed by simply putting "jQuery" directly within your product's name. This keeps your product easily recognized and consistent within the jQuery family.</p>

<div id="what-to-avoid">
	<h2>What to avoid</h2>

	<p>When building a plugin and deciding on naming, do not specify the specific framework you are using. The framework name (eg. jQuery UI, jQuery Mobile) should not appear in the product name, but it may appear in the tagline. Simply using the name "jQuery" in your naming convention for your product name is enough and does not require any more specification.</p>

	<h3>✅ Good</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="six columns">
			<h4>Product name:</h4>
			<p>jQuery Filterable Plugin</p>
		</div>
		<div class="six columns">
			<h4>Product tagline:</h4>
			<p>A jQuery UI compatible plugin to allow users to quickly bring large lists of data down to a manageable size.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<h3>❌ Bad</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="six columns">
			<h4>Product name:</h4>
			<p>jQuery UI Filterable Plugin</p>
		</div>
		<div class="six columns">
			<h4>Product tagline:</h4>
			<p>Pare that list down to size!</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>As you can see in the examples above, it is important to follow these guidelines and use the proper naming conventions for the specific framework you are utilizing.</p>
